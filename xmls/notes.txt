VMD Supported Water residue names = 
   { "H2O", "HHO", "OHH", "HOH", "OH2",
     "SOL", "WAT",
     "TIP", "TIP2", "TIP3", "TIP4",
     "SPC", NULL };

All waters are therefore given the resname WAT, to be consistent

Other changes necessary are the atom types must be converted from
A,B to OT,HT
Segments must be numbered to not contain duplicate resids within 1-9999

This is necessary to use the autoionize tool to add salts.
